Career Path Recommendation System 🎯
This project is a Career Path Recommendation System designed to help students receive personalized career
suggestions based on their academic records, personality traits, and extracurricular involvement.

🔍 Key Features
Machine Learning Models: Utilized K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forest algorithms to predict ideal career paths. The model achieved an accuracy of 82% during evaluation.
Clustering Analysis: Applied K-Means Clustering to categorize students based on extracurricular activity patterns, providing deeper insights into student profiles beyond academics.
Data Inputs: Academic performance data, personality test results (such as Big Five traits), and extracurricular logs are used to generate tailored recommendations.

🛠 Tech Stack
Backend: Built using the Django framework for robust and scalable server-side development.
Frontend: Designed a responsive user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure usability across devices.
Database: Used SQLite for rapid development and easy deployment.
ML Integration: Trained models are integrated into the Django views, allowing real-time prediction and clustering results.

✅ Outcomes
Helps students explore career paths aligned with both their academic strengths and personality characteristics.
Enables educational institutions to provide data-driven guidance to students.
Improves visibility of students’ hidden potential through extracurricular clustering.
